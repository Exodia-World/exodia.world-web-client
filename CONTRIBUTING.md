# How do I report a bug?

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Direct message [one of our maintainers](https://hub.decstack.com/decstack/messages/@vhz) on DecStack instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. Is this really a bug? If you're unsure, please read **Where can I ask for help?** to reach out to our community.
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
    * (*for desktop client*) What version of Exodia.World are you using?
    * (*for web client*) What browser and its version are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How do I suggest a feature or enhancement?

Is there something that you wish to exist in—or better yet—be removed from Exodia.World? Please open an issue on GitHub which describes the changes you would like to see, why you need them, and how they should work.

# Code Review Process

Each core programmer independently reviews pull requests every few days and each will suggest a revision. If there is no more revision needed, one of the core programmers will merge it into Exodia.World. As a rule of thumb, any code should satisfies all or at least a few of these criteria:

* *Simple* - it should be readable, has clear semantics, and use intuitive solutions
* *Small* - it should be small in text and in runtime space
* *Fast* - it should be fast enough for its purpose
* *Focused* - each of its components should do one and only one thing well
* *Isolated* - it should try its best to NOT depend on or change external state
* *Correct* - its should work as expected and accompanied by tests
* *Reusable* - it should prefer general/abstract solutions over specialized ones
* *Documented* - its behavior should be clearly and thoroughly documented
